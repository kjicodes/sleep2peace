# Sleep2Peace

Sleep2Peace is a sleep-tracking web application that allows users to record sleep cycles on a daily basis.

### How it works:

1. On the 'HOME' page, click the "Record Sleeps" button, to navigate to the "Add Sleep Cycle" page.

2. Once a sleep cycle is added, the app will redirect you to your "My Sleep Cycles" page, where you will be prompted to complete a "Wellness Check" form for the sleep cycle you just added. Each form will ask you questions related to the quality of your sleep.

3. You will also have the option to give personal feedback on each of your sleep cycles, as a way to keep yourself accountable on maintaining good quality sleeps.
